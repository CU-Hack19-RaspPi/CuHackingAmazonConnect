Integratre the amazon connect streaming api

The api can be found here [here](https://github.com/aws/amazon-connect-streams)

## Example code

To run the server put in `npm start` into your terminal

It will run a server on https://localhost:8080

If you want to host your hack at a different address you will need to let us know so we can whitelist it. If you don't amazon connect will reject your address.
